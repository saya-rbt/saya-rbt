# Hi! I'm Saya. ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Computer Science R&D engineer with a specialty in Robotics, HRI and Embedded Systems. ðŸ¤–

I dream of becoming a researcher and a teacher one day, in order to gather as much knowledge as I can since I love learning, as well as sharing that knowledge to anyone else who might be interested in it.

This GitHub account hosts some of my personal projects. Some of them are old, outdated or even not *that* great, but I wanted to make them public nonetheless because they might be useful to someone, who knows?

I'm working on HRI with social robots to make them interact with humans through pose estimation, head tracking, sounds and touch interactions, and multi-modal conversational analysis.

If you would like to contact me, don't hesitate to send me an email on the following address: saya-rbt@protonmail.com, or through my personal email address if you know it.

Thank you for reading and please enjoy your browsing ðŸ˜Š
