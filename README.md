# Hi! I'm Saya. ðŸ‘‹

## I'm an all-rounder Computer Science R&D engineer with a specialty in Systems Administration, Robotics, HRI and Embedded Systems.

My past experiences and projects have given me opportunities to work in software development, DevOps, cybersecurity, robotics, embedded development, Android development as well as desktop applications development. My skills give me a toolbox allowing me to adapt to any projects I find interesting. I do, however, specialize in Systems Administration, automation, and Python or C developement.

I'm currently working as a Systems Administrator and DevOps, automating infrastructure as code both on-premise and using Microsoft Azure. In the past, I was working on a Human-Robot Interactions research project, notably on social robots to make them interact with humans through pose estimation, head tracking, sounds and touch interactions, and multi-modal conversational analysis. I also work on embedded software, automation and Linux administration on my free time.

This GitHub account hosts some of my personal projects. Some of them are old, outdated or even not *that* great, but I wanted to make them public nonetheless because they might be useful to someone, who knows?

If you would like to contact me, don't hesitate to send me an email on the following address: saya-rbt(at)proton(dot)me, or through my personal email address if you know it.

Thank you for reading and please enjoy your browsing ðŸ˜Š
