# Hi! I'm Saya. ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Computer Science R&D engineer with a specialty in Robotics, HRI and Embedded Systems. ðŸ¤–

I'm currently working on HRI, notably on social robots to make them interact with humans through pose estimation, head tracking, sounds and touch interactions, and multi-modal conversational analysis. I also work on embedded software, automation and Linux administration on my free time.

This GitHub account hosts some of my personal projects. Some of them are old, outdated or even not *that* great, but I wanted to make them public nonetheless because they might be useful to someone, who knows?

If you would like to contact me, don't hesitate to send me an email on the following address: saya-rbt@proton.me, or through my personal email address if you know it.

Thank you for reading and please enjoy your browsing ðŸ˜Š
